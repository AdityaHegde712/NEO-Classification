# NEO-Detection
This project uses datasets from various sources like NASA, Amerigeoss, Kaggle, and Vizier to detect Near Earth Objects (NEOs) and classify them into hazardous and non-hazardous NEOs. The project therefore will work on 2 level classification:
1. The first level is currently planned to be binary classification, checking whether the detected data belongs to an NEO or a non-NEO. This may or may not change to a multi-class classification model between various types of NEOs.
2. The second level will be binary classification, checking whether the detected NEO is hazardous or non-hazardous.
